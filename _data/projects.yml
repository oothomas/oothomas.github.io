- title: "morphVQ: Functional-Map Morphometrics for Automated Phenotyping"
  description: >
    morphVQ replaces manual landmarking with learned surface descriptors and functional maps to quantify
    whole‑mesh shape variation with minimal observer bias. After light rigid alignment, the pipeline learns
    dense non‑rigid correspondences between specimens and refines them with Consistent ZoomOut, producing
    two interpretable latent operators—area‑based and conformal (angular) latent shape‑space differences
    (LSSDs). These capture surface‑wide expansions, contractions, and angular changes that drive biological
    variation.
    In head‑to‑head comparisons, LSSDs match or exceed modern 3DGM and auto3DGM on downstream tasks
    (e.g., Genus‑level classification), while being more computationally efficient and preserving far more of
    the true surface morphology. Shape spaces derived from morphVQ closely mirror expert landmark pipelines,
    and distinctiveness functions localize which anatomical regions separate groups—turning correspondences
    into spatially grounded evidence.
