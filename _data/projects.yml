- title: "AutoLandmark‑FM: Functional‑Map Landmarking for Mouse Mandibles"
  description: >
    This project develops an automated pipeline for anatomical landmark placement on 3D mouse
    hemi‑mandibles using descriptor learning and the functional map (FMap) framework. Instead of
    supervising to landmarks, the model learns intrinsic shape descriptors and dense functional
    correspondences in an unsupervised fashion, then recovers point‑to‑point maps to transfer
    landmarks across specimens. The workflow removes the need for rigid pre‑alignment and targets
    speed, accuracy, and generalizability.

    Methodologically, three upgrades over prior morphVQ are key: (1) orientation‑preserving Complex
    FMaps to avoid symmetry flips and eliminate pre‑alignment; (2) DiffusionNet for robust per‑vertex
    descriptors across mesh resolutions and surface complexities; and (3) spatial + spectral cycle
    consistency during Deep Functional Maps (DFMaps) training to enforce near‑bijective mappings and
    reduce post‑hoc refinement. Training is pairwise on meshes (LBO basis, WKS inputs), and dense
    correspondences are converted to landmark estimates via nearest‑neighbor transfer, aggregated with
    median selection for stability.

    Findings on a 425‑specimen mandible dataset show that the approach is faster than MALPACA while
    maintaining competitive accuracy. Although MALPACA often yields the lowest RMSE, AutoLandmark‑FM
    performs comparably—especially with smaller training sets—indicating strong generalization and
    practical viability. Visual checks confirm that automated placements typically fall within the
    acceptable range observed for MALPACA estimates.

    By combining unsupervised descriptor learning with functional correspondences, the
    pipeline scales landmarking to large cohorts, reduces manual effort, and flexibly adapts as
    hypotheses change (no re‑digitizing required). The result is a reproducible, high‑throughput
    alternative for morphometrics that plays nicely with open‑source tooling (e.g., 3D Slicer/SlicerMorph)
    and downstream statistical or ML analyses.

- title: "morphVQ: Functional-Map Morphometrics for Automated Phenotyping"
  description: >
    morphVQ replaces manual landmarking with learned surface descriptors and functional maps to quantify
    whole‑mesh shape variation with minimal observer bias. After light rigid alignment, the pipeline learns
    dense non‑rigid correspondences between specimens and refines them with Consistent ZoomOut, producing
    two interpretable latent operators—area‑based and conformal (angular) latent shape‑space differences
    (LSSDs). These capture surface‑wide expansions, contractions, and angular changes that drive biological
    variation.
    In head‑to‑head comparisons, LSSDs match or exceed modern 3DGM and auto3DGM on downstream tasks
    (e.g., Genus‑level classification), while being more computationally efficient and preserving far more of
    the true surface morphology. Shape spaces derived from morphVQ closely mirror expert landmark pipelines,
    and distinctiveness functions localize which anatomical regions separate groups—turning correspondences
    into spatially grounded evidence.
