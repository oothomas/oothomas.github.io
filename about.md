    <p>I am a computational biologist and machine learning researcher with a passion for decoding biological form. I specialize in biological shape analysis, AI-powered phenotyping, and functional morphology, using deep learning and advanced 3D imaging to quantify the rich information embedded in anatomical structures. My expertise spans both academic research and industry applications. I develop novel algorithms and pipelines that push the boundaries of scientific discovery while also translating these advances into practical tools for biomedical and evolutionary studies.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>I'm particularly drawn to questions about how shape encodes biological informationâ€”whether it reveals evolutionary patterns, reflects developmental processes, or signals the onset of disease. In pursuing these questions, I've worked with diverse 3D datasets across species and scales (from high-resolution scans of mouse bones to primate skeletal collections and clinical human images) while focusing on extracting quantitative phenotypes from complex morphology. A hallmark of my work is an emphasis on open science and tool-building: I develop robust, open-source software (such as 3D Slicer extensions) that enables high-throughput, reproducible shape analysis.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Through interdisciplinary collaborations across evolutionary biology, biomechanics, and AI, I aim to transform cutting-edge computational methods into accessible tools and translational applications. Ultimately, I strive to advance both scientific understanding and human health through this work.</p>
