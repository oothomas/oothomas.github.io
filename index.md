I specialize in computational anatomy, automated shape analysis, and statistical modeling of biological form. By leveraging deep learning and 3D visualization tools, I extract meaningful patterns from complex anatomical datasets, driving insights in evolutionary biology, comparative morphology, and clinical research applications.

With a PhD in Biological Anthropology and extensive experience in geometric deep learning, I develop scalable pipelines that transform raw micro-CT scans and imaging data into interpretable, quantitative phenotypes. My research bridges the gap between evolutionary theory, biomechanics, and advanced AI, aiming to uncover the functional and adaptive significance of shape variation across diverse taxa.
