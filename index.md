### Interactive Morphospace Tool
[Launch Roden Mandible Morphospace Viewer](assets/docs/projects/interactive_morphospace.html)

### SSC-MorphVQ for Landmark Placement
![Project Image](/assets/images/projects/ssc-morphvq.png "A schematic of the MorphVQ pipeline showing two input shapes, S1 and S2, each processed through a Siamese DiffusionNet to produce shape descriptors. These descriptors are projected onto eigenbases and passed into functional map estimation modules, including a main branch and a complex functional map branch. The figure highlights the integration of spectral and spatial cycle consistency and a regularization block, resulting in multiple functional map outputs and a combined loss function.")
*Adapted from Thomas & Maga "Leveraging Descriptor Learning and Functional Map-based Shape Matching for Automatic Landmark Acquisition" (In Press, Journal of Anatomy), this figure illustrates the enhanced MorphVQ pipeline for automatic landmark acquisition. It integrates Siamese DiffusionNet-based descriptor learning with functional map estimation and cycle consistency modules, streamlining the mapping of complex 3D shapes and improving both accuracy and efficiency in identifying morphological landmarks.*

**Description:** Developed a Spatially and Spectrally Consistent MorphVQ model to enhance automatic landmark acquisition in complex biological shapes.
**Practical Application:** Improves accuracy and reproducibility in morphometric analyses, enabling researchers to handle large-scale anatomical datasets with minimal manual intervention.
**Outcomes:**
- Reduced manual landmarking time by ~50%.
- Improved landmark placement accuracy across diverse taxa.
