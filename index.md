I specialize in computational biology, automated shape analysis, and the statistical modeling of biological form. By leveraging deep learning and 3D visualization tools, I extract meaningful patterns from complex anatomical datasets, driving insights in evolutionary biology, comparative morphology, and clinical research applications.

With a PhD in Biological Anthropology and extensive experience in morphometrics and deep learning, I develop scalable pipelines that transform biological surface and volume data into interpretable, quantitative phenotypes. My research bridges the gap between evolutionary theory, biomechanics, and advanced AI, aiming to uncover the functional and adaptive significance of shape variation across diverse taxa.
